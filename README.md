# foobar

This repository contains Questions and solutions encountered in the google secret hiring challenge known as foobar.

This challenge was attempted before having proper working knowledge of advanced data structures like Binary Search Trees(BSTs) and hence was solved mainly by using pattern analysis.

The current questions are upto level 3 and will be updated as I progress which I cannot right now as I have too much on my plate.

Thanks! ^_^

Questions:

- Access codes
- Doomsday fuel
- Efficiency
- Hey I already did that
- Ion flux relabeling
- Knight on a chessboard
- Please pass the coded message
- Queue to do
- Re ID
